# LifeAfter Top Up: Fueling Your Survival in the Apocalypse with Credits

LifeAfter throws you into a harsh, zombie-infested world where survival is a daily struggle. Building shelter, crafting gear, scavenging for resources, and teaming up with others are essential to withstand the brutal environment and infected hordes. While dedication and teamwork are crucial, having access to extra resources, powerful gear blueprints, or unique cosmetics can significantly ease your journey through the apocalypse. This is where performing a **LifeAfter top up** comes in, allowing players to acquire Federation Credits, the game's premium currency, to unlock various advantages and enhance their survival experience.

## Understanding Federation Credits

Federation Credits (often just called Credits) are the primary currency in LifeAfter purchased with real money. They are the key to accessing many premium features, bundles, and conveniences within the game that can accelerate progress or provide unique items.

## What Can You Get with a LifeAfter Top Up?

Topping up Federation Credits provides direct access to several benefits within the game:

### Buying Bundles and Gift Packs

The most common use of Credits is purchasing various bundles available in the shop. These often contain valuable resources like New Dollars, skill points, formula shards, or even rare materials that would take significant time to gather through normal gameplay.

### Acquiring Outfits and Cosmetics

Credits are used to buy exclusive cosmetic items, including character outfits, weapon skins, furniture, and pet accessories, allowing you to customize your appearance and safehouse.

### Purchasing the Survival Manual / Battle Pass

LifeAfter often features a seasonal progression system (similar to a Battle Pass). Purchasing the premium track with Credits unlocks significantly more rewards as you complete objectives throughout the season.

### Gacha / Formula Research

Credits or vouchers purchased with Credits can be used in formula research (gacha) to unlock potent gear blueprints or weapon attachments, which are vital for crafting high-tier equipment.

### Other Conveniences

Credits can sometimes be used for speeding up certain processes, purchasing convenience items, or refreshing shop offerings.
