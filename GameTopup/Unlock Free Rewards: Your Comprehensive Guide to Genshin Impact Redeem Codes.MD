### Gaming News Sites and Communities

Many dedicated Genshin Impact websites, gaming news portals, fan wikis, and community forums (like Reddit or Discord servers) actively track and compile lists of active redeem codes. They are often the quickest places to find new codes shared by the community after they are released, as well as maintain lists of any longer-term active codes. Staying connected with these communities is a great way to ensure you don't miss out.

## How to Redeem Your Genshin Codes

Redeeming a code is a quick and easy process, which you can do either through the official Genshin Impact website or sometimes directly in-game. The website method is generally the most reliable and widely used.

### Redeeming via the Official Website (Recommended)

1.  **Log In:** Go to the official Genshin Impact Redeem Code page ([https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift)) and log in with your HoYoverse account linked to your game character.
