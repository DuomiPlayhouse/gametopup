# Path of Exile 2 Release Date: What We Know and How to Prepare

The anticipation for Path of Exile 2 is palpable within the ARPG community. Following its stunning reveal, players have been eagerly awaiting news on exactly when they can dive into the next evolution of Grinding Gear Games' critically acclaimed title. Searches for the **Path of Exile 2 release date** are constant, reflecting the high level of excitement for the massive changes and new content promised. While a definitive launch date for the full game hasn't been locked in, here's a breakdown of what we currently know and how you can best prepare for the day Sanctuary's gates reopen.

## Current Status: Beta Testing Underway

As of recent announcements, Path of Exile 2 is currently in a closed Beta phase. This is a crucial step in the development process, allowing Grinding Gear Games to gather feedback, identify bugs, and balance gameplay on a larger scale than internal testing. Access to the Beta is limited, primarily granted through specific purchase packs or invitations.

### No Firm Release Date Yet

Despite the Beta being live, the developers have emphasized that they will **not** rush the release. The official stance remains that the game will launch **when it's ready**. This player-focused approach, while meaning a longer wait, aims to ensure a polished and high-quality experience at launch. Therefore, the **Path of Exile 2 release date** is still TBD (To Be Determined).

### Announced Platforms

Path of Exile 2 is planned for release on multiple platforms to reach as wide an audience as possible. These include:

*   PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the standalone client)
*   PlayStation 5
*   Xbox Series X/S

Cross-play and cross-progression are also planned features, allowing players to team up or switch devices seamlessly once the game is fully released.

## Why the Extended Development?

Path of Exile 2 isn't just a simple expansion; it's a complete overhaul and replacement of the original game's campaign, adding entirely new classes, skill systems, ascendancies, and significantly updated graphics and engine features. It will coexist with the original Path of Exile's endgame, sharing the same league structure and economy. The scope of this project is immense, requiring extensive testing and refinement to meet the high standards set by its predecessor.

## Preparing for Day One

While you wait for the official **Path of Exile 2 release date**, there are ways to engage with the Path of Exile universe and get ready for the new game:

### Play the Original Path of Exile

The original Path of Exile is still actively developed and receives regular league updates. Playing it is the best way to familiarize yourself with the core mechanics, endgame systems, and the overall feel of the game that POE2 will build upon. Your stash tabs and cosmetics will carry over!

### Follow Official Announcements

Keep a close eye on Grinding Gear Games' official website, social media, and ExileCon presentations for the latest news, development updates, and eventually, the crucial release date announcement.

### Plan Your First Build (Theoretically!)

With new classes and a revamped skill gem system, theorycrafting builds is a popular pastime. While details are subject to change, you can start thinking about what kind of character you want to play first based on the reveals so far.
